# Next.js Pages directory

This project is built with Next.js and TypeScript, utilizing the new App Router for an optimized and modular architecture. For state management and data fetching, the application leverages Zustand and Tanstack Query, ensuring efficient and scalable handling of application state and server-side data. SEO metadata will be carefully managed to improve the visibility and discoverability of the application.

The application focuses on an e-commerce cart system, with core functionalities like adding products to the cart, removing items, and updating quantities. These actions are seamlessly managed through Zustand's store, with the cart data being persistently stored in the local storage.

The cart interactions are designed to be user-friendly, accessible through a dropdown menu on desktop or a sidebar interface on mobile devices. The entire cart management system is built as a client component, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience across devices.
